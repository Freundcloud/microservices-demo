## üÜö Workspace vs. Classic Mode

### Why You Were Seeing "Classic Mode":
- You were using the standard Change Request list URL
- DevOps workspace has a different URL path: `/now/devops-change/home`
- Both are valid and available - it's not an error!

### Both Available:
| Interface | URL | Use Case |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| **DevOps Workspace** | `/now/devops-change/home` | Modern UI, CI/CD focus, DORA metrics |
| **Classic Change List** | `/change_request_list.do` | Traditional UI, all changes, advanced filtering |

Use whichever fits your workflow - both work perfectly!

## üéâ Problem Solved!

**Before Discovery**:
- ‚ùå Thought plugin wasn't installed
- ‚ùå Using classic UI only
- ‚ùå Missing modern workspace features
- ‚ùå No DORA metrics

**After Discovery**:
- ‚úÖ Plugin confirmed installed (v6.1.0)
- ‚úÖ Workspace URL identified
- ‚úÖ Full access verified
- ‚úÖ Setup guide provided
- ‚úÖ All features available

**Time to Resolution**: ~2 hours (research, verification, documentation)

**Root Cause**: Plugin was installed but correct workspace URL wasn't documented. The classic Change Request list URL worked fine, but the modern DevOps workspace required a different path.
