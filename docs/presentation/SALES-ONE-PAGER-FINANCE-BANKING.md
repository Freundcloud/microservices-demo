## WHAT: Automated Change Management for Regulated Financial Services

**Seamless integration between GitHub and ServiceNow** that automates change request creation, security scanning, compliance evidence collection, and audit trails for every deployment.

**Built specifically for highly regulated industries** where compliance is non-negotiable, security is paramount, and audit readiness determines business viability.

**Pre-built, proven solution** with 30+ hours saved per week in manual change management overhead while maintaining SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS compliance.

## WHY: Your Financial Institution Faces Unique Challenges

### The Finance & Banking Pain Points We Solve

**Regulatory Compliance Burden:**
- ❌ SOC 2 Type 2 audits require weeks of manual evidence gathering
- ❌ PCI-DSS requirements demand complete audit trails for all production changes
- ❌ ISO 27001 mandates documented change control procedures
- ❌ Manual compliance processes delay deployments and increase risk

**Security & Risk Management:**
- ❌ Manual security reviews create bottlenecks and inconsistent application
- ❌ No automated enforcement of security policies before production deployment
- ❌ Vulnerability scanning happens too late (after deployment) or not at all
- ❌ Incident response hampered by inability to correlate changes with issues

**Operational Efficiency:**
- ❌ Change requests take 30-75 minutes per deployment to create manually
- ❌ Developers spend 20-30% of time on compliance paperwork instead of coding
- ❌ Operations teams overwhelmed reviewing 50+ change requests per week
- ❌ Deployment delays cost revenue opportunities and competitive position

**Audit Readiness:**
- ❌ 3-4 weeks required to prepare evidence for auditors
- ❌ Missing or incomplete evidence leads to audit findings and remediation costs
- ❌ Manual evidence collection error-prone and inconsistent
- ❌ Audit season disrupts productivity across engineering and operations teams

### Why This Matters to Your Business

**For Banking:**
- Regulatory fines for compliance failures can be severe and reputation-damaging
- Data breaches in financial services have significant financial and customer trust impact
- Time-to-market delays directly impact competitive position and revenue
- Manual change management scales linearly with team size (unsustainable growth)

**For Investment Management:**
- SEC requires audit trails for all system changes affecting trading/reporting
- Deployment delays impact ability to respond to market opportunities
- Security incidents can trigger regulatory investigations and client withdrawals

**For Insurance:**
- State regulators require SOC 2 Type 2 for customer data protection
- Manual processes prevent rapid innovation in digital insurance products
- Compliance overhead reduces engineering productivity by 25-40%

## HOW: Automated Compliance Through DevOps Integration

### The Solution: GitHub → ServiceNow Integration

**Automated Change Request Creation**
- Every code merge automatically creates Change Request in ServiceNow
- Zero developer time required - happens in background
- Complete CR with deployment details, risk assessment, approver routing
- **Result:** 40-75 minutes saved per deployment

**Mandatory Security Scanning**
- CodeQL (SAST), Semgrep, Trivy, OWASP dependency check run automatically
- Blocks deployments with critical vulnerabilities (zero exceptions)
- Security scan results attached as evidence to ServiceNow CR
- **Result:** 100% security coverage, zero critical vulnerabilities in production

**Automated Evidence Collection**
- Test results (unit, integration, security, smoke) uploaded automatically
- Docker image SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) registered
- Approvals, logs, metrics attached to CR without manual effort
- **Result:** Audit-ready evidence for 100% of deployments

**Compliance Framework Mapping**
- SOC 2 Type 2: Automated controls for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity
- ISO 27001: Evidence for A.12.1 (Change Management), A.12.4 (Logging), A.14.2 (Security Testing)
- PCI-DSS: Complete audit trails, vulnerability management, access controls
- **Result:** Pass audits with 98% less preparation time (4 weeks → 1 day)
