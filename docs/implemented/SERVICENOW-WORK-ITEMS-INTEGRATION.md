# ServiceNow Work Items Integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Version**: 1.0

---

## Overview

Complete automated integration between GitHub Issues and ServiceNow DevOps Work Items (`sn_devops_work_item` table), providing end-to-end traceability between development work and change management.

### Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: [GitHub Issue #42](https://github.com/Freundcloud/microservices-demo/issues/42)

**Gaps**:
- ‚ùå GitHub Issues not linked to ServiceNow change requests
- ‚ùå No automated work item registration in sn_devops_work_item table
- ‚ùå Missing traceability between code changes and tracked work
- ‚ùå Manual effort required to document what issues are addressed in deployments

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Automatic extraction of GitHub issue numbers from commits and PRs
- ‚úÖ Automated work item creation/update in ServiceNow
- ‚úÖ Work items automatically linked to change requests
- ‚úÖ Complete bidirectional traceability (GitHub ‚Üî ServiceNow)

---

## Features

### 1. Automatic Issue Extraction

**Supported Commit Message Patterns**:
```
Fixes #42
Closes #123
Resolves #456
Refs #789
Issue: #101
Re: #202
[#303] Fix bug in cart service
```

**Extraction Sources**:
1. **Commit Messages**: Scans all commits in the push/PR
2. **PR Title**: Extracts issues from pull request title
3. **PR Description**: Scans PR body for issue references
4. **Fallback**: Scans last 10 commits if no explicit input

**Multiple Issues Support**:
```bash
# Single commit can reference multiple issues
git commit -m "Fixes #42, Closes #123, Resolves #456"

# Each issue will be registered as separate work item
```

### 2. ServiceNow Work Item Registration

**Fields Populated**:

| Field | Source | Example Value |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| `title` | GitHub issue title | "Implement GitHub Issues integration" |
| `type` | Mapped from GitHub labels | Issue, Story, Defect, Task |
| `source` | Hardcoded | "GitHub" |
| `external_id` | GitHub issue number | "42" |
| `url` | GitHub issue URL | `https://github.com/Freundcloud/microservices-demo/issues/42` |
| `state` | GitHub issue state | Open, Closed |
| `short_description` | GitHub issue title | "Implement GitHub Issues integration" |
| `description` | Issue body + context | Full description with metadata |
| `priority` | Mapped from GitHub labels | 1 (Critical), 2 (High), 3 (Moderate), 4 (Low) |
| `change_request` | From workflow input | CHG0030277 (sys_id) |

### 3. Label Mappings

#### Work Item Type

| GitHub Label | ServiceNow Type |
|-------------|----------------|
| `story` or `feature` | Story |
| `bug` | Defect |
| `task` | Task |
| (default) | Issue |

#### Priority

| GitHub Label | ServiceNow Priority |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `critical` or `urgent` | 1 - Critical |
| `high` | 2 - High |
| (default) | 3 - Moderate |
| `low` | 4 - Low |

### 4. Intelligent Duplicate Detection

**Uniqueness Check**:
- Checks for existing work items by: `external_id` + `source` + `url`
- Updates existing work items instead of creating duplicates
- Updates: `state`, `change_request` link

**Example**:
```bash
# First deployment: Creates work item WI0001050
git commit -m "Fixes #42: Initial implementation"

# Second deployment: Updates work item WI0001050 (no duplicate)
git commit -m "Refs #42: Add documentation"
```

## Workflow Details

### servicenow-register-work-items.yaml

**Trigger**: Called by MASTER-PIPELINE after change request creation

**Inputs**:
- `change_request_number` (required): ServiceNow CR number to link work items to
- `commit_messages` (optional): Explicit commit messages to scan
- `pr_number` (optional): Pull request number (if triggered by PR)

**Outputs**:
- `work_items_registered`: Count of work items created/updated
- `work_item_numbers`: Comma-separated list of work item numbers (e.g., "WI0001050,WI0001051")

**Job Steps**:

1. **Checkout Code**: Get full git history for commit scanning
2. **Extract GitHub Issue Numbers**:
   - Scan commit messages for issue patterns
   - Scan PR title/body if available
   - Fallback to recent commits
   - Remove duplicates and empty values
3. **Register Work Items in ServiceNow**:
   - Fetch issue details from GitHub (title, state, body, labels)
   - Map labels to type and priority
   - Check for existing work item
   - Create new or update existing
   - Link to change request
4. **Summary**: Display results in workflow summary

---

## Integration with MASTER-PIPELINE

### Workflow Job

```yaml
register-work-items:
  name: "üìã Register Work Items"
  needs: [pipeline-init, servicenow-change]
  if: |
    needs.servicenow-change.result == 'success' &&
    needs.servicenow-change.outputs.change_number != ''
  uses: ./.github/workflows/servicenow-register-work-items.yaml
  secrets: inherit
  with:
    change_request_number: ${{ needs.servicenow-change.outputs.change_number }}
    pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || '' }}
```

**Execution Order**:
1. Change request created in ServiceNow
2. **Work items registered** (new job)
3. Deployment happens
4. Change request updated with deployment status

**Dependencies**:
- Runs after: `servicenow-change` (needs CR number to link work items)
- Runs in parallel with: `deploy-to-environment` (independent)
- Included in: `pipeline-summary` (for reporting)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Developer commits code and references issue
git commit -m "Fixes #42: Implement work items integration"
git push origin main

# Workflow automatically:
# 1. Extracts issue #42
# 2. Fetches issue details from GitHub
# 3. Creates work item in ServiceNow
# 4. Links work item to change request
```

### Multiple Issues

```bash
# Single commit can reference multiple issues
git commit -m "Closes #42, Closes #43, Resolves #44"

# Result: 3 work items created, all linked to same change request
```

### Pull Request

```yaml
# PR Title: "Implement ServiceNow integration (Fixes #42)"
# PR Body: "This PR resolves #43 and closes #44"

# Result: Issues 42, 43, 44 extracted and registered
```

### Work Item Update

```bash
# First deployment
git commit -m "Fixes #42: Initial implementation"
# ‚Üí Creates WI0001050, state="Open"

# Close issue on GitHub
gh issue close 42

# Second deployment
git commit -m "Refs #42: Documentation"
# ‚Üí Updates WI0001050, state="Closed"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Work Items Created

**Problem**: Workflow runs but no work items appear in ServiceNow

**Possible Causes**:
1. No GitHub issues referenced in commits
2. Issue extraction regex didn't match pattern
3. GitHub API couldn't fetch issue (issue doesn't exist)
4. ServiceNow API error

**Solutions**:
1. Check workflow logs for "No GitHub issues found"
2. Use supported patterns: `Fixes #42`, `Closes #123`, etc.
3. Verify issue exists: `gh issue view 42`
4. Check ServiceNow API response in logs

### Work Items Not Linked to Change Request

**Problem**: Work items created but not linked to change request

**Possible Causes**:
1. Change request sys_id lookup failed
2. Change request doesn't exist
3. Insufficient permissions

**Solutions**:
1. Check workflow logs for "Could not find change request"
2. Verify CR number: Check servicenow-change job output
3. Verify ServiceNow user has permissions to link work items

### Duplicate Work Items

**Problem**: Multiple work items created for same GitHub issue

**Root Cause**: Uniqueness check failed (external_id + source + url didn't match)

**Solutions**:
1. Check if issue URL changed (unlikely)
2. Verify work items table schema
3. Check workflow logs for "Work item already exists"

### Wrong Work Item Type

**Problem**: GitHub issue labeled "bug" but ServiceNow shows "Issue"

**Root Cause**: Label mapping didn't work

**Solutions**:
1. Verify GitHub issue has correct label: `gh issue view 42 --json labels`
2. Check case sensitivity (labels are case-insensitive in mapping)
3. Review label mapping logic in workflow
