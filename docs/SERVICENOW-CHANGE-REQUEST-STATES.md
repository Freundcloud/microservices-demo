# ServiceNow Change Request States - Understanding the Workflow

**What You're Seeing**: "request approval" in the Change Request list

**Why**: The change request was created but is waiting for approval to be requested

---

## üîç Current Situation

### Change Request Details:
```
Number: CHG0030013
Short Description: Deploy Online Boutique to dev
State: New
Approval: Not Yet Requested
Environment: dev
Business Service: Online Boutique
```

### What "Request Approval" Means:
When you see "request approval" in the change request list, it means:
- ‚úÖ Change request was created successfully
- ‚è≥ Approval status is "Not Yet Requested"
- üìã State is "New" (not yet submitted for approval)
- üîÑ Waiting for approval to be requested before proceeding

This is **expected behavior** - it's not an error!

---

## üìä Change Request Lifecycle

### Standard ServiceNow Change Flow:

```
1. New (Created)
   ‚Üì
2. Assess (Risk Assessment)
   ‚Üì
3. Authorize (Approval Requested) ‚Üê You are here
   ‚Üì
4. Scheduled (Approved)
   ‚Üì
5. Implement (Deployment Proceeds)
   ‚Üì
6. Review (Post-Implementation)
   ‚Üì
7. Closed Complete
```

### Approval States:

| Approval State | Description | What Happens |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Not Yet Requested** | Initial state after creation | Nothing - waiting for approval request |
| **Requested** | Approval has been requested | Sent to approvers |
| **Approved** | All approvals granted | Can proceed to implementation |
| **Rejected** | Approval denied | Cannot proceed |
| **Cancelled** | Change cancelled | Workflow stops |

## üîß How Our Workflow Should Work

### For Dev Environment (Auto-Approved):
```
1. GitHub Actions creates change request
   ‚Üì
2. Change state: New
3. Approval: Not Yet Requested
   ‚Üì
4. Workflow requests approval (API call)
   ‚Üì
5. Dev auto-approval rule triggers
   ‚Üì
6. Approval: Approved
7. State: Scheduled
   ‚Üì
8. Deployment proceeds
   ‚Üì
9. State: Closed Complete
```

### For QA/Prod (Manual Approval Required):
```
1. GitHub Actions creates change request
   ‚Üì
2. Change state: New
3. Approval: Not Yet Requested
   ‚Üì
4. Workflow requests approval (API call)
   ‚Üì
5. Approval: Requested
6. Assigned to: QA Team / DevOps Team
   ‚Üì
7. Approver reviews and approves
   ‚Üì
8. Approval: Approved
9. State: Scheduled
   ‚Üì
10. Deployment proceeds
    ‚Üì
11. State: Closed Complete
```

## ‚ùì Why You're Seeing "Not Yet Requested"

### Current Workflow Behavior:

Looking at the change request created, it's in the "New" state with "Not Yet Requested" approval. This means:

1. **Change request was created** ‚úÖ
2. **Approval was NOT yet requested** ‚è≥
3. **Workflow is waiting** ‚è∏Ô∏è

### What Should Happen Next:

The workflow needs to **request approval** by updating the change request:

```bash
# API call to request approval
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approval": "requested",
    "state": "authorize"
  }' \
  "https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request/${CHANGE_SYS_ID}"
```

---

## üîç Checking the Workflow

Let me check if the workflow is requesting approval properly:

### Expected Workflow Steps:

1. **Create Change Request** ‚úÖ (This is working - CHG0030013 exists)
2. **Request Approval** ‚è≥ (This may be missing)
3. **Poll for Approval** ‚è≥ (Waiting every 30 seconds)
4. **Proceed with Deployment** ‚è≥ (After approval)
5. **Update Change Status** ‚è≥ (Mark as complete)

### Where We Are:
- Step 1: ‚úÖ Complete (CHG0030013 created)
- Step 2: ‚ùì Needs verification (approval should be requested)
- Steps 3-5: ‚è≥ Waiting

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Update Workflow to Request Approval

The current workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-with-servicenow-basic.yaml` creates the change request but may not be requesting approval.

### Required Changes:

After creating the change request, the workflow should:

1. **Set approval to "requested"**
2. **Update state to "authorize"** (or appropriate state)
3. **Then start polling**

### Current Workflow Section (Needs Update):
```yaml
- name: Create Change Request via REST API
  # Creates change but doesn't request approval
```

### Should Include:
```yaml
- name: Request Approval for Change
  run: |
    CHANGE_SYS_ID="${{ steps.create-cr.outputs.change_sys_id }}"

    # Request approval by updating change request
    curl -X PATCH \
      -H "Authorization: Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "approval": "requested",
        "state": "authorize"
      }' \
      "${SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL}/api/now/table/change_request/${CHANGE_SYS_ID}"
```

---

## üìã Manual Workaround (For Now)

Until we update the workflow, you can manually request approval:

### Option 1: Via ServiceNow UI
1. Open the change request: CHG0030013
2. Click: **Request Approval** button
3. For dev environment, it should auto-approve
4. For qa/prod, it will be sent to approvers

### Option 2: Via REST API
```bash
PASSWORD='oA3KqdUVI8Q_^>'
BASIC_AUTH=$(echo -n "github_integration:$PASSWORD" | base64)
CHANGE_SYS_ID="20cd77f2c3e4fe90e1bbf0cb050131b8"

# Request approval
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approval": "requested",
    "state": "authorize"
  }' \
  "https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request/${CHANGE_SYS_ID}"
```

---

## üîÑ Auto-Approval Rules

### Dev Environment Auto-Approval:

For dev environment, we should have an approval rule that:
- Triggers when: Environment = "dev"
- Action: Auto-approve
- No human interaction needed

### Checking If Rule Exists:
```bash
PASSWORD='oA3KqdUVI8Q_^>'
curl -s -u "github_integration:$PASSWORD" \
  "https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/api/now/table/sysapproval_approver?sysparm_query=document_id=20cd77f2c3e4fe90e1bbf0cb050131b8" \
  | jq .
```

## üéØ What You Should See

### In Change Request List:
When properly configured, you should see:

**For Dev (Auto-Approved)**:
```
Number: CHG0030013
State: Scheduled (or Implement)
Approval: Approved
Approver: System (auto-approved)
```

**For QA/Prod (Manual)**:
```
Number: CHG0030014
State: Authorize
Approval: Requested
Assigned to: QA Team / DevOps Team
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Manually request approval** for CHG0030013 (dev environment):
   - This will trigger auto-approval
   - Verify it works as expected

2. **Update workflow** to automatically request approval after creating change:
   - Add approval request step
   - Test with dev deployment

3. **Verify auto-approval rules** are configured:
   - Dev should auto-approve
   - QA/Prod should require manual approval

## üìä Viewing Change Requests

### What to Look For:

When viewing the change request list:
- **Number**: CHG0030013
- **Short Description**: Deploy Online Boutique to dev
- **State**: Should progress from "New" ‚Üí "Authorize" ‚Üí "Scheduled" ‚Üí "Implement" ‚Üí "Closed"
- **Approval**: Should change from "Not Yet Requested" ‚Üí "Requested" ‚Üí "Approved"

### Filtering:
```
https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/change_request_list.do?sysparm_query=business_service.name=Online%20Boutique
```

This shows all changes for the Online Boutique application.

## üîß Workflow Update Required

I'll create an updated workflow that properly requests approval after creating the change request.
