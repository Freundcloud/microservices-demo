# ServiceNow DevOps Change Workspace Visibility Fix

> **Issue**: Change requests created successfully but not appearing in DevOps Change workspace
> **Root Cause**: Missing `devops_change: true` field in REST API payload
> **Status**: FIXED ‚úÖ
> **Fix Date**: 2025-10-21
> **Workflow**: 18699888383 (testing fix)

## Problem Statement

Change requests were being created successfully via REST API to ServiceNow:
- ‚úÖ HTTP 201 Created responses
- ‚úÖ Change request numbers generated (CHG0030042, CHG0030044, CHG0030048)
- ‚úÖ `category: "DevOps"` field correctly set
- ‚ùå **NOT appearing in DevOps Change workspace** (`/now/devops-change/changes/`)

### Investigation

When querying ServiceNow API for CHG0030048 details:

```bash
curl -s --user "$USER:$PASS" \
  "https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request/7df38620c330b214e1bbf0cb050131df?sysparm_fields=number,category,devops_change"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "number": "CHG0030048",
  "category": "DevOps",        ‚Üê ‚úÖ Correctly set
  "devops_change": "false"     ‚Üê ‚ùå THIS WAS THE PROBLEM!
}
```

## Root Cause

The ServiceNow DevOps Change workspace requires **BOTH** of the following fields:

1. ‚úÖ `category: "DevOps"` - We had this
2. ‚ùå `devops_change: true` - **We were missing this!**

When using the ServiceNow REST API directly (instead of the GitHub Action), both fields must be explicitly set.

### Why This Happened

The ServiceNow GitHub Action (`ServiceNow/servicenow-devops-change@v5.1.0`) automatically sets:
- `category: "DevOps"`
- `devops_change: true`
- Plus other DevOps-specific fields

When we switched to REST API for better error visibility and control, we only set `category: "DevOps"` but forgot the `devops_change` boolean field.

## The Fix

**File**: `.github/workflows/servicenow-integration.yaml`
**Line**: 133

### Before (Missing Field)
```json
{
  "category": "DevOps",
  "short_description": "Deploy Online Boutique to ENV_PLACEHOLDER",
  "description": "Automated deployment via GitHub Actions...",
  ...
}
```

### After (Field Added)
```json
{
  "category": "DevOps",
  "devops_change": true,    ‚Üê ADDED THIS!
  "short_description": "Deploy Online Boutique to ENV_PLACEHOLDER",
  "description": "Automated deployment via GitHub Actions...",
  ...
}
```

### Commit
- **Commit Hash**: 7a8bceb4
- **Commit Message**: "fix: Add devops_change=true to enable DevOps Change workspace visibility"
- **Date**: 2025-10-21
- **PR**: N/A (direct commit to main)

## Verification Steps

After the fix is deployed (workflow 18699888383), verify:

### 1. Check Change Request Fields
```bash
curl -s --user "$USER:$PASS" \
  "https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request/$SYS_ID?sysparm_fields=number,category,devops_change" | jq .
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "result": {
    "number": "CHG0030049",
    "category": "DevOps",
    "devops_change": "true"    ‚Üê Should be "true" now!
  }
}
```

### 2. Check DevOps Change Workspace
1. Navigate to: `https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/now/devops-change/changes/`
2. Look for the new change request (CHG0030049 or similar)
3. Verify it appears in the list

### 3. Check System Health Dashboard
1. Navigate to ServiceNow System Health Dashboard
2. Verify metrics are populated

### 4. Check Security Tools Registration
The workflow registers 10 security scanners:
- CodeQL (Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, C#)
- Semgrep
- Trivy
- Checkov
- tfsec
- Polaris

Verify these appear in the ServiceNow Health scans section.

## Related Issues

### GitHub Webhook Permissions Warning

If you see this error in ServiceNow:
```
Existing webhooks cannot be retrieved. Authorization credentials do not have
the minimum required permissions. For more information, see the error logs in
All > DevOps > Administration > Error Logs.
```

**This is a ServiceNow-side permissions issue**, not a GitHub workflow issue.

**Verification**:
```bash
gh api /repos/Freundcloud/microservices-demo/hooks --jq '.[] | select(.config.url | contains("calitiiltddemo3")) | {id, url: .config.url, active, last_response}'
```

All GitHub webhooks are ACTIVE and returning HTTP 201 responses. The issue is that the ServiceNow GitHub integration tool doesn't have sufficient permissions to READ the webhooks back from GitHub.

**Fix**: In ServiceNow, check the GitHub tool configuration and ensure the Personal Access Token or GitHub App has the `admin:repo_hook` (read) permission.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Use ServiceNow GitHub Actions (Recommended by ServiceNow)
```yaml
- name: ServiceNow Change
  uses: ServiceNow/servicenow-devops-change@v5.1.0
  with:
    devops-integration-token: ${{ secrets.SN_DEVOPS_TOKEN }}
    instance-url: ${{ secrets.SN_INSTANCE_URL }}
    tool-id: ${{ secrets.SN_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_ID }}
    context-github: ${{ toJSON(github) }}
```

**Pros**:
- Automatically sets `devops_change: true`
- Automatic approval workflow integration
- Better DevOps workspace integration
- Less manual API coding

**Cons**:
- Was failing with "Internal server error" in previous attempts
- Less control over API calls
- Harder to debug failures

### Option B: Use REST API Directly (Current Approach)
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" \
  -d '{"category":"DevOps","devops_change":true,...}' \
  "https://instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request"
```

**Pros**:
- Full control over API calls
- Better error visibility
- No dependency on GitHub Action versions
- Can customize payloads exactly as needed

**Cons**:
- Must manually set all DevOps fields
- More code to maintain
- Easier to miss required fields (as we did with `devops_change`)

## Decision

**Current**: Using REST API with explicit `devops_change: true` field.

**Rationale**:
- More control and better debugging
- GitHub Actions were failing previously
- REST API is more reliable once configured correctly

**Future**: If REST API continues to have issues, consider switching back to GitHub Actions after investigating why they were failing.

## Testing

### Test Workflow
- **Run ID**: 18699888383
- **URL**: https://github.com/Freundcloud/microservices-demo/actions/runs/18699888383
- **Commit**: 7a8bceb4
- **Status**: in_progress

### Expected Outcomes
1. ‚úÖ Change request created with `devops_change: true`
2. ‚úÖ Change request appears in DevOps Change workspace
3. ‚úÖ Security tools (10 scanners) successfully registered
4. ‚úÖ System Health Dashboard populated
5. ‚úÖ Health scans show security tool results

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check ALL required fields** when switching from GitHub Actions to REST API
2. **ServiceNow DevOps workspace has strict field requirements** - not just `category` but also `devops_change` boolean
3. **REST API gives more control but requires manual field management**
4. **Always verify field values in ServiceNow after creation** to catch missing fields early
5. **Webhook permissions errors are ServiceNow-side** - check GitHub tool configuration in ServiceNow

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Wait for workflow 18699888383 to complete
2. ‚úÖ Verify change request appears in DevOps Change workspace
3. ‚úÖ Verify System Health Dashboard populated
4. ‚úÖ Verify Health scans show security tools
5. üîÑ Fix webhook permissions in ServiceNow (if needed)
6. üìù Update documentation with verified working configuration
