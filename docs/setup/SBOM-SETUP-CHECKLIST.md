# ServiceNow SBOM Integration - Setup Checklist

Quick reference for setting up SBOM integration with ServiceNow.

## âœ… Pre-Implementation Checklist

### ServiceNow Configuration

- [ ] **Verify Vulnerability Response plugin installed**
  ```
  Navigate to: System Applications â†’ All Available Applications â†’ All
  Search for: "Vulnerability Response"
  Status: Should show "Installed" or "Active"
  ```

- [ ] **Grant sbom_ingest role to integration user**
  ```
  Navigate to: User Administration â†’ Users
  Find user: github_integration (or your integration user)
  Roles â†’ Edit â†’ Add role: sbom_ingest
  Save
  ```

- [ ] **Verify user credentials work**
  ```bash
  # Test with curl or the verification script
  curl -u "username:password" \
    "https://instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/sys_user?sysparm_limit=1"

  # Should return HTTP 200 with user data
  ```

### GitHub Secrets

- [ ] **Add or update SN_SBOM_USER**
  ```
  Navigate to: Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
  Add secret: SN_SBOM_USER
  Value: github_integration (or your SBOM user)
  ```

- [ ] **Add or update SN_SBOM_PASSWORD**
  ```
  Add secret: SN_SBOM_PASSWORD
  Value: [password for SBOM user]
  ```

- [ ] **Verify SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL exists**
  ```
  Check existing secret: SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL
  Format: https://instance.service-now.com (no trailing slash)
  ```

- [ ] **Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has repo scope**
  ```
  This is automatically provided by GitHub Actions
  No action needed - automatically available
  ```

### Optional: Business Applications

- [ ] **Create business applications in ServiceNow (recommended)**
  ```
  Navigate to: Business Applications â†’ Create New

  Create for each service:
  - Name: "Online Boutique - frontend"
  - Name: "Online Boutique - cartservice"
  - Name: "Online Boutique - productcatalogservice"
  ... (repeat for all 12 services)
  ```

## âœ… Post-Implementation Verification

### Test SBOM Upload

- [ ] **Trigger a build manually**
  ```bash
  # Option 1: Use promote script
  just promote 1.2.6 all

  # Option 2: GitHub Actions UI
  Navigate to: Actions â†’ MASTER-PIPELINE
  Click: "Run workflow"
  Environment: dev
  Force build: true
  Run workflow
  ```

- [ ] **Check GitHub Actions output**
  ```
  Expected in build summary:
  âœ… SBOM generated and uploaded to ServiceNow
  âœ… Business Application: `Online Boutique - {service}`
  âœ… Lifecycle Stage: `pre_production`
  ```

- [ ] **Verify in ServiceNow**
  ```
  Navigate to: Vulnerability Response â†’ SBOM Workspace â†’ Documents

  Expected: 12 new SBOM documents (one per service)
  Format: microservices-demo/sbom-{service}.json
  Build ID: Should match GitHub run number
  ```

- [ ] **Check vulnerability correlation**
  ```
  Open any SBOM document
  Click "Vulnerabilities" tab
  Expected: List of CVEs (if any vulnerabilities exist)
  Status: Should show severity, CVSS score, affected packages
  ```

### Troubleshooting

- [ ] **If SBOM upload fails with 401 error**
  ```
  â†’ Check: SN_SBOM_USER has sbom_ingest role
  â†’ Check: Password in SN_SBOM_PASSWORD is correct
  â†’ Check: User is active in ServiceNow
  ```

- [ ] **If no SBOMs appear in ServiceNow**
  ```
  â†’ Wait 5-10 minutes for processing
  â†’ Check ServiceNow system logs for errors
  â†’ Verify Vulnerability Response plugin is active
  â†’ Check that workflow step didn't skip (continue-on-error: true)
  ```

- [ ] **If vulnerabilities not showing**
  ```
  â†’ Wait up to 15 minutes for correlation
  â†’ Verify fetchVulnerabilityInfo: true in workflow
  â†’ Check ServiceNow vulnerability database is updated
  â†’ Contact ServiceNow admin if database access is restricted
  ```

## âœ… Ongoing Operations

### Monitor SBOM Uploads

- [ ] **Regular verification** (weekly)
  ```
  Check in ServiceNow: SBOM Workspace â†’ Documents
  Verify recent builds have SBOMs uploaded
  Check for any failed uploads
  ```

- [ ] **Review vulnerabilities** (weekly)
  ```
  Navigate to: Vulnerability Response â†’ Dashboard
  Review critical/high vulnerabilities
  Create change requests for remediation
  Track fixes across environments
  ```

### Maintenance

- [ ] **Rotate SBOM credentials** (90 days)
  ```
  1. Create new password for SN_SBOM_USER in ServiceNow
  2. Update SN_SBOM_PASSWORD secret in GitHub
  3. Test with a manual build
  4. Delete old password from password manager
  ```

- [ ] **Review business application mappings** (quarterly)
  ```
  Verify all services have correct business applications
  Update mappings if services are renamed
  Archive applications for retired services
  ```
