   - Reverts to previous stable version
   - Automatic for all deployments in namespace
   - Expected duration: 2-5 minutes

2. VERIFICATION:
   kubectl rollout status deployment/<service> -n microservices-prod
   kubectl get pods -n microservices-prod
   - Verify all pods Running
   - Check no CrashLoopBackOff
   - Confirm service endpoints healthy

3. FULL ENVIRONMENT REVERT (if needed):
   kubectl delete -k kustomize/overlays/prod
   kubectl apply -k kustomize/overlays/prod@previous-tag
   - Complete environment restoration
   - Expected duration: 5-10 minutes

4. POST-ROLLBACK VALIDATION:
   - Run health checks on all services

   - Create incident if data loss occurred

6. EMERGENCY CONTACTS:
   - On-call engineer: Check PagerDuty rotation
   - Platform team: #platform-support channel
   - ServiceNow: github_integration user

Rollback Approval: Automatic (no approval needed for rollback)
Data Loss Risk: NONE (stateless application)
Downtime Window: 2-10 minutes depending on method
```

**Audit Evidence**:
- Every change request has detailed rollback plan
- Includes specific commands and steps
- Documents expected duration and data loss risk
- Provides emergency contacts
- Proves changes are reversible

## ‚è≥ Remaining Work

### 4. Emergency Change Workflow

**Requirement**: SOC 2 CC7.4
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING**
**Effort**: 1 day
**Priority**: üü° MEDIUM (not blocking for normal operations)

**What's Needed**:
- Add `change_type` input to workflow (normal/standard/emergency)
- Modify change request creation to handle emergency type
- Set higher risk level for emergency changes
- Require post-emergency review
- Document emergency justification

**Implementation Plan**:
```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    environment:
      required: true
      type: choice
      options: [dev, qa, prod]
    change_type:
      description: 'Change Type'
      required: true
      default: 'normal'
      type: choice
      options:
        - normal      # Standard change (default)
        - standard    # Pre-approved standard change
        - emergency   # Emergency/hotfix

# In change request creation:
if [ "${{ github.event.inputs.change_type }}" == "emergency" ]; then
  TYPE="emergency"
  RISK="high"
  JUSTIFICATION="Emergency change to resolve production incident"
  POST_REVIEW_REQUIRED="true"
  APPROVAL_GROUP="emergency-approvers"
else
  TYPE="normal"
  # ... standard logic
fi
```

**Benefits**:
- Proper emergency change tracking
- Higher scrutiny for emergency deployments
- Mandatory post-emergency review
- Clear audit trail for urgent fixes
