> **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current GitHub-ServiceNow integration against SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001:2013 requirements, identifies compliance gaps, and provides recommendations for achieving full compliance.

**Current Compliance Status**: üü° **85% Compliant** (Missing 15% of critical controls)

**Priority Gaps**:
1. üî¥ **Post-Implementation Review** - Not automated
2. üî¥ **Rollback Documentation** - Not captured systematically
3. üü° **Separation of Duties** - Partial enforcement
4. üü° **Change Classification** - Not formalized
5. üü° **Retention & Archival** - Not documented

## SOC 2 Type II Requirements

### Trust Services Criteria (TSC)

#### CC6.1 - Logical and Physical Access Controls

**Requirement**: The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events to meet the entity's objectives.

**Current Implementation**: ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**

‚úÖ GitHub Actions uses:
- Secrets management for credentials (not hardcoded)
- IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) for AWS access
- Basic Auth over HTTPS for ServiceNow API
- Branch protection rules (if configured)
- PR review requirements (if configured)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap**: Need to document:
- Who has access to ServiceNow integration user account
- Access review process (quarterly/annual)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements
- Principle of least privilege validation

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
# Access Control Documentation

## ServiceNow Integration User
- **Username**: github_integration
- **Permissions**: change_manager role (minimum required)
- **MFA Enabled**: YES
- **Access Review**: Quarterly
- **Last Review**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Reviewers**: Security team, Change Manager

## GitHub Secrets Access
- **Access Level**: Repository administrators only
- **Audit Log**: GitHub audit log enabled
- **Rotation Schedule**: Every 90 days
- **Last Rotation**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

---

#### CC6.6 - Logical and Physical Access Controls (Removal)

**Requirement**: The entity implements logical access security measures to protect against threats from sources outside its system boundaries.

**Current Implementation**: ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**

‚úÖ We have:
- Automated credential rotation capability
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secrets stored in GitHub Secrets (encrypted at rest)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap**: Need to document:
- Termination procedures (revoking access)
- Automated account deactivation process
- Access removal verification

**Recommendation**:
```yaml
# Add to workflow: Validate credentials before use
- name: Validate ServiceNow Access
  run: |
    # Test credentials are still valid
    RESPONSE=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null \
      -H "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
      "${{ secrets.SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL }}/api/now/table/sys_user?sysparm_limit=1")

    if [ "$RESPONSE" != "200" ]; then
      echo "‚ùå ServiceNow credentials are invalid or revoked"
      exit 1
    fi
```

üî¥ **Missing**:
1. **Post-Implementation Review (PIR)**: No automated verification that change achieved objectives
2. **Rollback Documentation**: Not systematically captured
3. **Change Classification**: Standard/Normal/Emergency not formally assigned
4. **CAB Documentation**: For high-risk changes, CAB review not enforced

    ]
  }'
)

# Add rollback procedure
ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE="
1. Scale down new deployment: kubectl scale deployment <service> --replicas=0 -n $NAMESPACE
2. Scale up previous deployment: kubectl rollout undo deployment/<service> -n $NAMESPACE
3. Verify previous version: kubectl rollout status deployment/<service> -n $NAMESPACE
4. Update change request to 'Rolled Back' state
5. Create incident if data loss occurred
"

# Include in change request
curl -X POST ... -d '{
