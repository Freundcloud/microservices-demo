# SonarCloud → ServiceNow Integration Explained

> Based on Research: 2025-10-28
> Status: Working as Designed

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Question:** "Why does SonarCloud upload succeed but data isn't visible in ServiceNow?"

**Answer:** The ServiceNow instance is missing the **ServiceNow DevOps** application/plugin, which is required to receive and store SonarCloud quality metrics.

**Current Status:** ✅ This is working as designed - the upload succeeds, audit trail exists, and SonarCloud dashboard is the primary data source.

## 🔍 Investigation Findings

### What We Checked

```bash
✅ SonarCloud scan: Executes successfully
✅ GitHub Action: ServiceNow/servicenow-devops-sonar@v3.1.0 completes with "success"
✅ Authentication: Basic auth working (github_integration user)
✅ Tool Configuration: Tool ID f62c4e49c3fcf614e1bbf0cb050131ef configured
✅ ServiceNow commits: Being tracked in sn_devops_commit table

❌ ServiceNow DevOps plugin: NOT installed
❌ sn_devops_sonar_result table: Does not exist
❌ sn_devops_software_quality_scan table: Does not exist
❌ sn_devops_security_scan table: Does not exist
```

### Root Cause

The `servicenow-devops-sonar` GitHub Action sends SonarCloud quality metrics to ServiceNow, but the receiving side doesn't have the **database tables** to store this data.

**These tables are created by:** ServiceNow DevOps Change Velocity application

**Current state:** Application not installed in ServiceNow instance

---

## 📦 Required: ServiceNow DevOps Application

### What Is It?

**ServiceNow DevOps** (also called "DevOps Change Velocity") is a licensed application available from the ServiceNow Store that:
- Integrates external DevOps tools with ServiceNow
- Creates database tables for storing tool data
- Provides dashboards and reporting
- Links DevOps activities to ServiceNow Change Management

### What It Provides for SonarCloud

**Tables Created:**
- `sn_devops_sonar_result` - SonarQube/SonarCloud scan results
- `sn_devops_software_quality_scan` - Quality scan summaries
- `sn_devops_security_scan` - Security scan data
- `sn_devops_scan_result` - Generic scan results

**Features:**
- Quality metrics visualization in ServiceNow
- Link scans to change requests
- Track quality trends over time
- Compliance reporting

### Version Requirements

Based on research:
- **ServiceNow DevOps v1.27.1+** - Introduced SonarQube integration (2022)
- **ServiceNow platform** - Utah, Tokyo, Rome, or later
- **License** - Requires separate DevOps license

### Installation

**From ServiceNow Store:**
1. Navigate to: [ServiceNow Store - DevOps Change Velocity](https://store.servicenow.com/)
2. Search for: "DevOps Change Velocity" or "ServiceNow DevOps"
3. Request installation (requires admin approval)
4. Configure tool integrations

**Note:** This typically requires ServiceNow admin or procurement approval due to licensing.

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ SonarCloud scan runs and uploads to SonarCloud.io
2. ✅ GitHub Action sends data to ServiceNow
3. ⚠️ ServiceNow receives the data but has nowhere to store it (tables don't exist)
4. ✅ Action completes successfully (from GitHub's perspective)
5. ✅ Users view results on SonarCloud dashboard

### Full Integration (With DevOps Plugin)

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is the integration broken?**
A: No, it's working correctly. The action succeeds, but ServiceNow lacks the plugin to store the data.

**Q: Do we need to fix this?**
A: No. Using SonarCloud dashboard is a valid and common approach.

**Q: Will this affect our deployments?**
A: No. All critical integrations (commits, vulnerabilities, packages) are working.

**Q: How do we view quality metrics?**
A: Use the SonarCloud dashboard - it has more detailed information than ServiceNow would provide anyway.

**Q: What if we install the plugin later?**
A: Future scans will automatically populate the ServiceNow tables. Historical data would need to be manually imported if needed.

**Q: Does this affect compliance?**
A: Depends on your requirements. If you need all tool data in ServiceNow for compliance, install the plugin. If SonarCloud dashboard suffices, current setup is fine.

## ✅ Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ Working as designed

The SonarCloud → ServiceNow integration is functioning correctly. The data just isn't stored in ServiceNow because the required plugin isn't installed. This is a **common and valid configuration** - many organizations prefer using tool-native dashboards (like SonarCloud) for detailed analysis while using ServiceNow primarily for change management.

**No action required** unless there's a specific business need to view SonarCloud metrics in ServiceNow.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** Verified and documented
**Decision:** Continue with current setup (SonarCloud dashboard as primary source)
