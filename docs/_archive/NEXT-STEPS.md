## üöÄ Immediate Actions (Choose One Path)

### Path A: Start with POC (Recommended - 30 minutes)

**Why**: Validate the concept quickly before full implementation

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Create reusable workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows/_reusable

# 2. Move security-scan to reusable folder
git mv .github/workflows/security-scan.yaml .github/workflows/_reusable/security-scan.yaml
git commit -m "refactor: Move security-scan to reusable workflows"
git push

# 3. Create MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml
# Copy the POC template from docs/WORKFLOW-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
# (Search for "Quick Start: Build POC")

# 4. Commit and test
git add .github/workflows/MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml
git commit -m "feat: Add Master Pipeline POC (security + deploy)"
git push

# 5. Trigger the POC
gh workflow run MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml -f environment=dev

# 6. Watch it run
gh run watch
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Security scans run (via reusable workflow)
- Deployment to dev succeeds
- Pods become healthy
- Entire flow completes in ~20 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Workflow completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Dev environment updated
- ‚úÖ Faster than running separate workflows
- ‚úÖ Team comfortable with new approach

**If POC fails**: Review logs, fix issues, iterate
**If POC succeeds**: Proceed to Path B (full implementation)

---

### Path B: Full Implementation (After POC validation)

**Timeline**: 1-2 days (6-8 hours of work)

**Phase 1: Build Reusable Workflows** (2-3 hours)

Create these 5 files in `.github/workflows/_reusable/`:

1. **terraform-plan.yaml** (30 min)
   - Copy template from WORKFLOW-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
   - Test: `gh workflow run _reusable/terraform-plan.yaml -f environment=dev`

2. **terraform-apply.yaml** (30 min)
   - Extract from existing terraform-apply.yaml
   - Make it accept environment parameter
   - Test with dev environment

3. **build-images.yaml** (45 min)
   - Implement path filtering for 12 services
   - Matrix build strategy
   - Test: Should only build changed services

4. **deploy-environment.yaml** (30 min)
   - Kustomize-based deployment
   - Environment-specific namespaces
   - Rollout waiting and verification

5. **servicenow-integration.yaml** (45 min)
   - Change request creation
   - Security result registration (12 tools)
   - Change request closing

**Phase 2: Build Master Pipeline** (2-3 hours)

Update `MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml` to include all 6 stages:

```yaml
# Stage 1: Security (already in POC)
# Stage 2: Infrastructure (new - conditional Terraform)
# Stage 3: Build images (new - smart filtering)
# Stage 4: ServiceNow (new - change management)
# Stage 5: Deploy (already in POC)
# Stage 6: Smoke tests (new - verification)
```

Copy complete template from WORKFLOW-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md

**Phase 3: Testing** (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Test each reusable workflow individually
gh workflow run _reusable/build-images.yaml -f environment=dev
gh workflow run _reusable/deploy-environment.yaml -f environment=dev

# Test full master pipeline
gh workflow run MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml -f environment=dev

# Test with options
gh workflow run MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml \
  -f environment=dev \
  -f skip_terraform=true

# Test conditional execution
# (Make a change to one service, verify only that service builds)
```

**Phase 4: Parallel Running** (1 week)

Run new master pipeline **alongside** old workflows:
- Builds confidence
- Validates feature parity
- Allows rollback if needed

**Phase 5: Deprecation** (1 hour)

```bash
# Create deprecated folder
mkdir -p .github/workflows/DEPRECATED

# Move old workflows (keep the ones being used for now)
git mv .github/workflows/build-and-push-images.yaml .github/workflows/DEPRECATED/
git mv .github/workflows/deploy-application.yaml .github/workflows/DEPRECATED/
# ... (move 15+ old workflows)

# Commit
git commit -m "refactor: Deprecate old workflows in favor of Master Pipeline"
git push
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: POC workflow fails

**Check**:
```bash
# View workflow run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Check if security-scan moved correctly
ls -la .github/workflows/_reusable/security-scan.yaml

# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/MASTER-PIPELINE.yaml
```

**Common causes**:
- Security-scan.yaml not in correct location
- Secrets not configured
- YAML syntax error
- AWS credentials expired

### Issue: Path filtering not working

**Check**:
```bash
# Make sure dorny/paths-filter action is used
grep -A 10 "paths-filter" .github/workflows/_reusable/build-images.yaml

# Test by changing one service
echo "// test" >> src/frontend/main.go
git add . && git commit -m "test: trigger frontend build only"
git push

# Should only build frontend, not all 12 services
```

### Issue: ServiceNow integration fails

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify secrets are set
gh secret list

# Required secrets:
# - SN_DEVOPS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN
# - SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL
# - SN_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_ID

# Test ServiceNow connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SN_DEVOPS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN" \
  "$SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL/api/now/table/sys_user?sysparm_limit=1"
```

### Issue: Reusable workflow not found

**Error**: `workflow_call event is not supported`

**Fix**: Ensure the workflow is in `_reusable/` folder and has:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      # ... parameters
```

## üéì Decision Points

Before starting implementation, decide:

### 1. Timeline
- [ ] **Aggressive** (1 week) - POC + full implementation
- [ ] **Moderate** (2 weeks) - POC, testing, phased rollout
- [ ] **Conservative** (4 weeks) - POC, extended parallel running, gradual migration

### 2. Scope
- [ ] **Minimal** - POC only (security + deploy)
- [ ] **Standard** - All 6 stages with smart filtering
- [ ] **Advanced** - Include auto-rollback, canary deployments

### 3. ServiceNow Integration
- [ ] **Keep DevOps Change API** (current, feature-rich)
- [ ] **Simplify to Basic Table API** (simpler, fewer features)
- [ ] **Hybrid approach** (DevOps API for prod, Basic for dev/qa)

### 4. Approval Gates
- [ ] **Manual approval for prod** (safer, recommended)
- [ ] **Automatic with rollback** (faster, riskier)
- [ ] **Manual for qa and prod** (most conservative)
