## Key Features

### 1. Environment-Specific Policies

**Dev Environment**:
- ✅ Auto-approved (no manual intervention)
- ✅ Auto-closes after deployment
- ✅ Low risk, low priority
- ⏱️ Deploys immediately (~5 minutes)

**QA Environment**:
- ✅ Single approval required
- ✅ QA Team Lead approval
- ✅ Medium risk, high priority
- ✅ Load generator included for testing
- ⏱️ Approval SLA: 2 hours

**Prod Environment**:
- ✅ Multi-level sequential approval
- ✅ Stage 1: DevOps Lead (1 required)
- ✅ Stage 2: CAB (2 required)
- ✅ High risk, critical priority
- ✅ High availability (3 replicas)
- ✅ No load generator in production
- ⏱️ Approval SLA: 24 hours

---

### 2. Approval Workflow

**Create Change Request**:
```json
{
  "autoCloseChange": false,  // true for dev only
  "attributes": {
    "short_description": "Deploy microservices-demo to prod",
    "description": "Automated deployment via GitHub Actions...",
    "implementation_plan": "1. Run security scans\n2. Build manifests...",
    "backout_plan": "kubectl rollout undo...",
    "test_plan": "1. Check pod status\n2. Verify endpoints..."
  }
}
```

**Wait for Approval**:
- GitHub Actions workflow pauses
- Polls ServiceNow every 30 seconds
- Displays progress in workflow UI
- Times out after configured period
- Resumes immediately upon approval

**Resume After Approval**:
- Workflow continues automatically
- Pre-deployment checks run
- Application deployed
- Health checks performed
- CMDB updated
- Change Request closed

---

### 3. Approval Groups

**Three groups created automatically**:

1. **QA Team**
   - Purpose: QA environment approvals
   - Manager: Current user (customizable)
   - Members: QA team leads and engineers

2. **DevOps Team**
   - Purpose: Infrastructure ownership
   - Manager: DevOps Lead
   - Members: DevOps engineers, SREs

3. **Change Advisory Board (CAB)**
   - Purpose: Production approvals
   - Manager: CTO/VP Engineering
   - Members: Executives, leads from all teams

---

### 4. Audit & Compliance

**Full Audit Trail**:
- ✅ Who requested the change
- ✅ When it was requested
- ✅ Who approved/rejected
- ✅ Approval timestamps
- ✅ Deployment outcome
- ✅ Close notes with details

**Compliance Reports**:
- All production changes require documented approval
- Approval turnaround time tracking
- Rejection reasons logged
- Emergency change frequency monitoring

---

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup (30 minutes)

#### 1. Run Automated Script

```bash
cd /home/olafkfreund/Source/Calitti/ARC/microservices-demo

# Set credentials
export SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL="https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com"
export SERVICENOW_USERNAME="github_integration"
export SERVICENOW_PASSWORD='oA3KqdUVI8Q_^>'

# Run setup
bash scripts/setup-servicenow-approvals.sh
```

**Output**:
```
[SUCCESS] QA Team created
[SUCCESS] DevOps Team created
[SUCCESS] Change Advisory Board created
```

#### 2. Add Team Members (via ServiceNow UI)

Navigate to: https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/sys_user_group_list.do

Add additional members to each group.

#### 3. Test Deployment

```bash
# Test dev (no approval)
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow.yaml --field environment=dev

# Test qa (single approval)
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow.yaml --field environment=qa

# Test prod (multi-level approval)
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow.yaml --field environment=prod
```

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Automated setup script runs successfully
- [ ] Three approval groups created in ServiceNow
- [ ] Current user is manager of all groups
- [ ] Dev deployment completes without approval (< 5 min)
- [ ] QA deployment waits for approval
- [ ] QA deployment resumes after approval
- [ ] Prod deployment requires DevOps Lead approval first
- [ ] Prod deployment requires 2 CAB approvals second
- [ ] Prod deployment completes after all approvals
- [ ] Rejection properly fails the workflow
- [ ] All change requests visible in ServiceNow

---

## Usage Examples

### Deploy to Dev (No Approval)

```bash
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow.yaml \
  --repo Freundcloud/microservices-demo \
  --field environment=dev
```

**Expected**: Deploys immediately, auto-closes change request

---

### Deploy to QA (Requires QA Approval)

```bash
# Trigger deployment
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow.yaml \
  --repo Freundcloud/microservices-demo \
  --field environment=qa

# Workflow pauses, waiting for approval
# Approve in ServiceNow UI or via email
# Workflow resumes automatically
```

**Expected**: Pauses for approval, resumes within 30 seconds of approval

---

### Deploy to Prod (Requires Multi-Level Approval)

```bash
# Trigger deployment
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow.yaml \
  --repo Freundcloud/microservices-demo \
  --field environment=prod

# Workflow pauses for Stage 1: DevOps Lead
# DevOps Lead approves
# Workflow pauses for Stage 2: CAB (2 required)
# 2 CAB members approve
# Workflow resumes automatically
```

**Expected**: Two approval stages, resumes after all approvals

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

### ServiceNow Dashboard Views

**Pending Approvals**:
```
Navigate: Self-Service → My Approvals
Filter: State = Requested
Sort: Created (oldest first)
```

**Change Request History**:
```
Navigate: Change → All
Filter: Short description contains "microservices-demo"
Sort: Created (newest first)
```

**Approval Metrics**:
- Average approval time by environment
- Rejection rate
- Emergency change frequency
- Rollback rate

---

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Stuck "Waiting for Approval"

**Check**: Change Request state in ServiceNow

```bash
PASSWORD='oA3KqdUVI8Q_^>' bash -c 'curl -s -u "github_integration:$PASSWORD" \
  "https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request?sysparm_query=number=CHG0123456" \
  | jq ".result[0] | {state, approval}"'
```

**Expected**: `"approval": "approved"`

**Fix**: Approve in ServiceNow, wait 30 seconds

---

### Approval Not Resuming Workflow

**Symptoms**: Approved in ServiceNow but workflow still waiting

**Causes**:
1. ServiceNow DevOps Change plugin not installed
2. Orchestration Tool ID mismatch
3. Polling interval not elapsed (wait 30s)

**Fix**:
1. Verify plugin: Navigate to Plugins → "DevOps Change" → Active
2. Check `SERVICENOW_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL_ID` secret matches ServiceNow config
3. Wait 30 seconds and check workflow again

---

### No Email Notifications

**Check**: System → Email → Outbound → Configuration

**Fix**: Enable SMTP configuration, test email

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- ✅ Only authorized approvers can approve changes
- ✅ Approval history fully audited
- ✅ Cannot bypass approval workflow
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Change Control

- ✅ Production changes require executive approval
- ✅ Implementation plan required
- ✅ Backout plan required
- ✅ Test plan required
- ✅ Risk assessment automatic

---

## Best Practices

### For Deployment Requesters

✅ **DO**:
- Test in dev and qa before prod
- Provide detailed implementation plan
- Include clear backout procedure
- Deploy during maintenance windows
- Monitor deployment metrics

❌ **DON'T**:
- Deploy untested code to prod
- Skip qa environment testing
- Make changes without backout plan
- Deploy during peak hours without approval

---

### For Approvers

✅ **DO**:
- Review implementation plan thoroughly
- Verify testing completed in lower environments
- Check for security implications
- Ensure monitoring and alerting in place
- Approve/reject within SLA

❌ **DON'T**:
- Rubber-stamp approvals
- Approve without reading
- Ignore risk indicators
- Skip rollback plan review

---

## Integration Points

### GitHub Actions
