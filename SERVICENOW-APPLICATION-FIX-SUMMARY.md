---

## ✅ Resolution Implemented

### 1. Created Fix Documentation
**[docs/SERVICENOW-APPLICATION-CREATION-FIX.md](docs/SERVICENOW-APPLICATION-CREATION-FIX.md)**
- Complete explanation of the issue
- Required field details
- Available application categories
- Manual and automated solutions
- Update instructions for existing applications

### 2. Created Automated Script
**[scripts/create-servicenow-application.sh](scripts/create-servicenow-application.sh)**
- Checks if application exists
- Creates with all required fields:
  - `name`: "Online Boutique"
  - `application_category`: "Service Delivery" (sys_id: `18d3b632210e3b00964f98b7f95cf808`)
  - `operational_status`: "Operational"
  - `short_description`: "Cloud-native microservices demo application on AWS EKS"
  - `description`: Full description
- Updates existing applications missing Application Category
- Returns sys_id for next steps

### 3. Updated Quick Start Guide
**[docs/SERVICENOW-APPLICATION-QUICKSTART.md](docs/SERVICENOW-APPLICATION-QUICKSTART.md)**
- Added Step 0: Application Creation
- Added troubleshooting for Application Category error

Name: Online Boutique
sys_id: 4ffc7bfec3a4fe90e1bbf0cb0501313f
Status: Operational
Category: Service Delivery
```

---

## ✅ Configuration Completed

### 1. Application Created ✅
- **Name**: Online Boutique
- **sys_id**: `4ffc7bfec3a4fe90e1bbf0cb0501313f`
- **Application Category**: Service Delivery
- **Status**: Operational

### 2. GitHub Secret Configured ✅
```bash
gh secret set SERVICENOW_APP_SYS_ID -R Freundcloud/microservices-demo
```
- Secret: `SERVICENOW_APP_SYS_ID`
- Value: `4ffc7bfec3a4fe90e1bbf0cb0501313f`
- Status: ✅ Configured (verified)

### 3. Service Dependency Mapping ⏳ In Progress
```bash
bash scripts/map-service-dependencies.sh
```
- Status: Running (verifying services in CMDB)
- Expected: 33+ relationships for 11 microservices across 3 namespaces

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Remaining)

### Step 1: Complete Service Dependency Mapping
The dependency mapping script is currently running. Once complete, you'll have:
- Frontend → 6 downstream services mapped
- Checkoutservice → 4 downstream services mapped
- Cartservice → Redis relationship mapped
- All 3 namespaces (dev/qa/prod) mapped

### Step 2: Test Deployment with Application Association
```bash
gh workflow run deploy-with-servicenow-basic.yaml --field environment=dev -R Freundcloud/microservices-demo
```

**What this will do**:
- Create change request with application association
- Change request will include:
  - `business_service`: Points to "Online Boutique" application
  - `cmdb_ci`: Links to application CI
  - `u_application`: "Online Boutique"
- Dev environment auto-approves immediately
- Deployment proceeds
- Change request updated with results

### Step 3: Verify in ServiceNow DevOps Change Workspace
1. Navigate to: **DevOps Change** → **Change Requests**
2. Direct link: https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/change_request_list.do?sysparm_query=business_service.name=Online%20Boutique
3. Verify change request shows:
   - ✅ Application: Online Boutique
   - ✅ Environment: dev
   - ✅ Status: Closed Complete
   - ✅ Related Services: All 11 microservices

### Step 4: View Complete Dependency Graph
1. Navigate to: **Configuration** → **CMDB** → **CI Relationship Editor**
2. Search for: **frontend**
3. Click: **Visualize** → **Dependency View**
4. You should see:
```
frontend
├── cartservice
│   └── redis-cart
├── productcatalogservice
├── currencyservice
├── recommendationservice
├── adservice
└── checkoutservice
    ├── paymentservice
    ├── shippingservice
    ├── emailservice
    └── currencyservice
```
