## Overview

This document summarizes all GitHub Actions workflow fixes applied to resolve errors and warnings identified during CI/CD pipeline execution.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Kustomize Build Error (FIXED)

**Issue**: `kustomize-build-ci.yaml` workflow failing due to reference to non-existent `google-cloud-operations` component.

**Error Message**:
```
Error: accumulating components: loader.New "must build at directory: not a valid directory:
evalsymlink failure on 'kustomize/components/google-cloud-operations':
lstat kustomize/components/google-cloud-operations: no such file or directory"
```

**Root Cause**: Test configuration in `kustomize/tests/service-mesh-istio-with-all-components/kustomization.yaml` referenced a GCP-specific component that doesn't exist in our AWS migration.

**Fix**:
- Commented out reference to `../../components/google-cloud-operations` in line 21
- Added comment explaining this was removed as part of AWS migration

**File Changed**: `kustomize/tests/service-mesh-istio-with-all-components/kustomization.yaml`

**Status**: ✅ Workflow now passes successfully

---

### 2. TFLint Warning - Missing Provider Version (FIXED)

**Warning**: `Missing version constraint for provider "null" in required_providers`

**Root Cause**: The `null` provider was being used (via `null_resource` in eks.tf) but didn't have a version constraint defined in `versions.tf`.

**Fix**:
- Added null provider to `required_providers` block with version constraint `~> 3.0`

**File Changed**: `terraform-aws/versions.tf`

**Before**:
```hcl
required_providers {
  aws = { ... }
  kubernetes = { ... }
  helm = { ... }
  kubectl = { ... }
}
```

**After**:
```hcl
required_providers {
  aws = { ... }
  kubernetes = { ... }
  helm = { ... }
  kubectl = { ... }
  null = {
    source  = "hashicorp/null"
    version = "~> 3.0"
  }
}
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

### 3. TFLint Warnings - Unused Variables (FIXED)

**Warnings**:
```
Warning - variable "availability_zones" is declared but not used
Warning - variable "namespace" is declared but not used
Warning - variable "deploy_app" is declared but not used
Warning - variable "enable_metrics_server" is declared but not used (FALSE POSITIVE)
```

**Root Cause**:
- `availability_zones`, `namespace` - Only used in .terraform modules (terraform-aws-modules/vpc and eks), not our code
- `deploy_app` - Completely unused, leftover from earlier architecture
- `enable_metrics_server` - FALSE POSITIVE: Actually used in `helm-installs.tf`, but that file wasn't committed to git

**Fix**:
- Removed `availability_zones` variable declaration from `variables.tf` line 45-49
- Removed `namespace` variable declaration from `variables.tf` line 117-121
- Removed `deploy_app` variable declaration from `variables.tf` line 123-127
- Committed `helm-installs.tf` to git (which uses `enable_metrics_server`)

**Files Changed**:
- `terraform-aws/variables.tf`
- `terraform-aws/helm-installs.tf` (added to git)

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## ⚠️ Known Non-Critical Issues

### 1. Security Scanning Workflow Issues

**Fixed Issues**:
- ✅ **Gitleaks**: Disabled (requires paid license for organizations) - See commit 63dec8f2

**Remaining Issues**:
- **CodeQL Java**: Autobuild failure (needs custom build configuration)
- **tfsec/Trivy**: SARIF upload failures (non-blocking)

**Status**: ⚠️ Non-blocking

**Recommendations**:
1. **Secret Scanning Alternative**: Use GitHub's built-in secret scanning (free for public repos) or TruffleHog
2. **CodeQL Java**: Add custom build steps for Java services (adservice, shoppingassistantservice)
3. **SARIF uploads**: Can be ignored if not using GitHub Security tab

---

### 2. Terraform Apply Workflow Failures

**Issue**: `Terraform Apply - AWS Infrastructure` workflow fails

**Root Cause**: Requires AWS credentials to be configured in GitHub Secrets

**Status**: ⚠️ Expected behavior - this workflow only runs when AWS infrastructure needs to be deployed

**Recommendation**: Configure AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets when ready to deploy infrastructure

## Workflow Status After Fixes

| Workflow | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **kustomize-build-ci** | ✅ Passing | Fixed google-cloud-operations reference |
| **Terraform Validation and Testing** | ⚠️ Partial | TFLint now passing, Cost Estimation requires AWS creds |
| **Terraform Format Check** | ✅ Passing | All files properly formatted |
| **Documentation Check** | ✅ Passing | No issues |
| **Security Scanning** | ⚠️ Optional | Non-blocking warnings, can be configured later |
| **Terraform Apply** | ⚠️ Expected | Requires AWS credentials for deployment |

## Testing Instructions

To verify all fixes:

1. **Test Kustomize Build Locally**:
   ```bash
   cd kustomize/tests/service-mesh-istio-with-all-components
   kubectl kustomize .
   # Should complete successfully without errors
   ```

2. **Test TFLint Locally**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform-aws
   tflint --init
   tflint --recursive
   # Should show 0 warnings
   ```

3. **Test Terraform Formatting**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform-aws
   terraform fmt -check -recursive
   # Should show no changes needed
   ```

4. **Monitor GitHub Actions**:
   ```bash
   gh run list --limit 5
   # Check latest workflow runs

   gh run view <run-id>
   # View specific workflow details
   ```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always commit generated files used by Terraform**: `helm-installs.tf` was created but not committed, causing false positive lint warnings.

2. **Remove unused variables promptly**: Variables like `availability_zones`, `namespace`, and `deploy_app` were declared but never used in our code (only in external modules).

3. **Test locally before pushing**: Running `tflint --recursive` and `kubectl kustomize .` locally would have caught these issues earlier.

4. **Document GCP → AWS migration changes**: The `google-cloud-operations` component reference should have been removed when migrating from GCP to AWS.

5. **GitHub Actions workflows need proper AWS credentials**: Cost estimation and deployment workflows will fail without proper AWS IAM configuration in GitHub Secrets.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Kustomize build error - FIXED
2. ✅ TFLint warnings - FIXED
3. ⚠️ Security scanning - Optional, configure if needed
4. ⚠️ AWS credentials for deployment - Required for Terraform Apply workflow
