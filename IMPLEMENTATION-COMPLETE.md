# Workflow Consolidation - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

> **Date**: 2025-10-27
> **Commit**: 4e2f4dfb
> **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## üéâ All Implementation Tasks Completed

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Fixed Kustomization Files

**Changed all environments to use environment tags:**
```yaml
# Dev: newTag: dev
# QA: newTag: qa
# Prod: newTag: prod
```

**Result**: All tags exist in ECR - no more ImagePullBackOff errors

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Created Automated Promotion Script

**File**: `scripts/promote-version.sh` (executable)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Promote all services
just promote 1.1.8 all

# Promote specific services
just promote 1.1.9 frontend,cartservice
```

**What it automates**:
1. Creates release branch
2. Updates kustomization files
3. Creates and auto-merges PR
4. Deploys to DEV (auto-approved)
5. Prompts for QA (manual approval in ServiceNow)
6. Prompts for PROD (manual approval in ServiceNow)
7. Creates GitHub release

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Verified ServiceNow Auto-Approval

**Confirmed**: `servicenow-change.yaml` already has perfect auto-approval logic

- DEV: `state: implement` (auto-approved)
- QA/PROD: `state: assess` (awaiting approval)

No changes needed!

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Added ServiceNow Integration to MASTER-PIPELINE

**New jobs added** (194 lines):

1. **upload-test-results** - After builds
   - Uploads to `sn_devops_test_result` table

2. **register-packages** - After builds
   - Registers Docker images in `sn_devops_package` table

3. **servicenow-change** - Before deployment
   - Creates Change Request in `change_request` table
   - Auto-approves for dev, manual for qa/prod

4. **upload-config-to-servicenow** - After deployment
   - Uploads Kubernetes configs to `sn_devops_config_validate` table

**Updated pipeline-summary job** to include all ServiceNow stages

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Cleaned Up Justfile

**Removed** (broken semantic versioning):
- `promote-all VERSION`
- `promote-all-auto VERSION`
- `promote-to-qa VERSION`
- `promote-to-prod VERSION`

**Added** (working environment tags):
- `promote VERSION SERVICES` - Automated full promotion
- `promote-all VERSION` - Alias for promote VERSION all
- `promote-service SERVICE VERSION` - Promote specific service
- `deploy-dev` - Manual DEV deployment
- `deploy-qa` - Manual QA deployment
- `deploy-prod` - Manual PROD deployment
- `rebuild-all ENV` - Force rebuild all services

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Deleted Obsolete Workflows

**Deleted**:
- `.github/workflows/full-promotion-pipeline.yaml` (broken)
- `.github/workflows/promote-environments.yaml` (unnecessary)

**Kept** (reusable):
- `build-images.yaml`
- `deploy-environment.yaml`
- `servicenow-change.yaml`
- `security-scan.yaml`
- `terraform-*.yaml`

---

   - Problem analysis
   - Target architecture
   - 5-phase implementation plan

## üß™ Ready for Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Automated Full Promotion

```bash
# This should now work end-to-end
just promote 1.1.8 all
```

**Expected behavior**:
1. ‚úÖ Creates `release/v1.1.8` branch
2. ‚úÖ Updates kustomization files (dev/qa/prod use env tags)
3. ‚úÖ Creates Pull Request
4. ‚úÖ Waits for CI checks to pass
5. ‚úÖ Auto-approves and merges PR
6. ‚úÖ Deploys to DEV (ServiceNow CR auto-approved)
7. ‚è∏Ô∏è Prompts: "Deploy to QA?"
8. ‚úÖ Deploys to QA (ServiceNow CR requires manual approval)
9. ‚è∏Ô∏è Prompts: "Deploy to PROD?"
10. ‚úÖ Deploys to PROD (ServiceNow CR requires manual approval)
11. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release
12. üéâ Complete!

### Test Scenario 2: ServiceNow Evidence Verification

**After running a deployment, verify in ServiceNow**:

1. **Test Results** - https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sn_devops_test_result_list.do
   - Should see test results from build

2. **Packages** - https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sn_devops_package_list.do
   - Should see Docker images registered

3. **Change Requests** - https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/change_request_list.do
   - DEV: state = "implement" (auto-approved)
   - QA/PROD: state = "assess" (awaiting approval)

4. **Config Snapshots** - https://calitiiltddemo3.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/sn_devops_config_validate_list.do
   - Should see Kubernetes configs uploaded

### Test Scenario 3: Manual Environment Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to specific environment
just deploy-qa
```

**Expected behavior**:
1. Triggers MASTER-PIPELINE with environment=qa
2. Creates ServiceNow Change Request (requires approval)
3. Waits for approval in ServiceNow
4. Deploys to microservices-qa namespace
5. Runs smoke tests
6. Success!

### Test Scenario 4: Verify Pod Deployments

```bash
# Check that all pods are running with correct images
kubectl get pods -n microservices-dev -o wide | grep -E "frontend|cartservice"

# Verify image tags
kubectl get deployment frontend -n microservices-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
# Should output: 533267307120.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/frontend:dev

kubectl get deployment frontend -n microservices-qa -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
# Should output: 533267307120.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/frontend:qa

kubectl get deployment frontend -n microservices-prod -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
# Should output: 533267307120.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/frontend:prod
```
