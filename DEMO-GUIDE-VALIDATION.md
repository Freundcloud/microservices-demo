# Demo Guide Validation Summary

> **Date**: 2025-10-27
> **Status**: ‚úÖ Updated and Validated
> **Files Updated**: `docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md`

## Question

> "so is this correct now what it says in the docs/Demo-guide.md ?"

## Answer: YES ‚úÖ (with updates applied)

The Demo Guide is now **fully accurate** and reflects the current implementation after applying the updates below.

---

## What Was Checked

### ‚úÖ **Verified: `just promote-all` Command**

The justfile command `promote-all` correctly calls the fixed `full-promotion-pipeline.yaml`:

```bash
gh workflow run full-promotion-pipeline.yaml \
    -f version={{VERSION}} \
    -f auto_promote_qa=true \
    -f auto_promote_prod=false
```

This matches exactly what the Demo Guide documents:
- ‚úÖ Auto-promotes to QA
- ‚úÖ Requires manual approval for PROD
- ‚úÖ Creates release tags

### ‚úÖ **Verified: Workflow Behavior**

The Demo Guide's description of the promotion flow is accurate:

1. ‚úÖ Updates kustomization.yaml files (NEW - we added this)
2. ‚úÖ Commits version changes to git (NEW - we added this)
3. ‚úÖ Deploys to DEV automatically
4. ‚úÖ Auto-promotes to QA
5. ‚úÖ Waits for ServiceNow approval for PROD
6. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release tag

---

## Updates Applied to Demo Guide

To ensure complete accuracy, we updated these sections:

### 1. **Demo Scenario 3: Step 1 - "What this does"**

**BEFORE** (Incomplete):
```markdown
**What this does**:
1. ‚úÖ Creates version bump PR (auto-merges)
2. ‚úÖ Deploys to DEV automatically
3. ‚úÖ Waits for DEV success
4. ‚úÖ Auto-promotes to QA
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Waits for manual approval for PROD
6. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release tag
```

**AFTER** (Complete with new version update step):
```markdown
**What this does**:
1. ‚úÖ Updates dev kustomization.yaml with version 1.1.8
2. ‚úÖ Commits version change to git (automated)
3. ‚úÖ Deploys to DEV automatically
4. ‚úÖ Waits for DEV success
5. ‚úÖ Auto-promotes to QA (updates qa kustomization.yaml)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Waits for manual approval for PROD
7. ‚úÖ Deploys to PROD (updates prod kustomization.yaml)
8. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release tag (v1.1.8)
```

**Why Updated**:
- Added the new `update-dev-version` job we created in the workflow fix
- Clarified that kustomization files are updated for each environment
- Shows the complete end-to-end flow

---

### 2. **Demo Scenario 3: Step 2 - "Monitor Progress"**

**BEFORE** (Generic):
```markdown
```bash
# Check deployment status across environments
just promotion-status 1.1.8

# Output shows:
# - DEV: ‚úÖ Deployed
# - QA: ‚è≥ In Progress
# - PROD: ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting for approval
```

**In GitHub Actions**:
- Show: "Full Promotion Pipeline" workflow
- Show: Each environment deployment in real-time
- Show: Manual approval step for production
```

**AFTER** (Detailed timeline):
```markdown
**In GitHub Actions** (watch in real-time):

1. **Update Dev Kustomization** (< 30 seconds)
   - Updates `kustomize/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`
   - Commits: `chore: Update dev to version 1.1.8 - Automated promotion pipeline`
   - Pushes to main branch

2. **Deploy to DEV** (5-10 minutes)
   - ServiceNow Change Request created (auto-approved)
   - All 12 services deployed with version 1.1.8
   - Config uploaded to ServiceNow

3. **Promote to QA** (5-10 minutes)
   - Validates version exists in dev
   - Updates `kustomize/overlays/qa/kustomization.yaml`
   - ServiceNow CR created (requires approval)
   - Deploys after ServiceNow approval

4. **Wait for PROD Approval** (manual step)
   - Shows: "Manual Approval Required for PROD" message
   - Waits for ServiceNow CR approval

**Check status via CLI**:

```bash
# Check deployment status across environments
just promotion-status 1.1.8

# Output shows:
# - DEV: ‚úÖ Deployed
# - QA: ‚úÖ Deployed
# - PROD: ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting for ServiceNow approval
```
```

**Why Updated**:
- Shows the NEW version update step (first job in workflow)
- Provides timing estimates for each stage
- Shows git commits being created automatically
- Clarifies ServiceNow CR creation at each stage
- Makes it easier to follow along during a live demo

---

### 3. **Demo Scenario 3: Step 3 - "Approve Production Deployment"**

**BEFORE** (Mentioned GitHub UI approval):
```markdown
**Option 1: GitHub UI**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Freundcloud/microservices-demo/actions
2. Find "Full Promotion Pipeline" workflow
3. Click on the run
4. Click "Review deployments"
5. Select "production" environment
6. Click "Approve and deploy"

**Option 2: ServiceNow** (if configured)
1. Open ServiceNow Change Request
2. Review test results and security scans
3. Approve the change
4. GitHub Actions continues automatically
```

**AFTER** (ServiceNow-first, with clarification):
```markdown
**ServiceNow Approval** (Required)
1. QA deployment completes successfully
2. ServiceNow Change Request created automatically for PROD
3. Workflow **pauses** waiting for ServiceNow approval
4. Approver reviews in ServiceNow:
   - Test results from all 12 services
   - Security scan results (SBOM, vulnerabilities)
   - Deployment configurations
5. Approver approves the Change Request in ServiceNow
6. GitHub Actions detects approval and continues automatically
7. PROD deployment proceeds

**Note**: With `auto_promote_prod=false`, the workflow creates the CR but waits for ServiceNow approval before deploying. This is the **recommended** approach for production deployments.

**Alternative - Manual GitHub Trigger**:
If you want to approve via GitHub instead of ServiceNow:
1. Re-run the workflow with `auto_promote_prod=true`
2. ServiceNow CR will still be created and must be approved
3. Use this only if ServiceNow integration is not configured
```

**Why Updated**:
- Emphasizes ServiceNow approval as the PRIMARY mechanism
- Removes reference to GitHub Environment approval (we removed those in the workflow fix)
- Clarifies the workflow PAUSES behavior
- Shows what approvers see in ServiceNow (test results, security scans)
- Provides clear alternative if ServiceNow is not configured
